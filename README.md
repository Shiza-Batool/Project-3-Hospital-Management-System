# Hospitial Management System

# Abstract
Every system needs management to operate normally. So does a hospital for itâ€™s smooth work flow. To keep its data intact and accessible, this program has been made. Just think because of data mishap, how many people can end up going to wrong medical specialist. How many appointments would not have taken place just because of slow flow of data.
Thus, we applied the knowledge of C++ OOP gained in class to make a program that covers up such problems in an hospital, clinic, dispensary, etc.

# Introduction of your project
The project is designed to manage record of three main bodies of a hospital. Through this project, keeping records and their safety is easy. This project provides a clean user interface for patients, doctors, and administration. Doctors can track down their patients, upcoming appointments, and departments, etc. Vice versa for patients. Administration can easily manage other bodies through this.

# Methodology/ Plan development to solve the Problem
We applied the knowledge we gained in object-oriented programming. The main three modules of this management system are:
- Administration Module.
- Doctor Module.
- Patient Module.
- All these modules will have login, add, view and deleting functionalities. Data will be handled by file handling.

# Administrator Module:
- Sign in to system
- Add a Doctor
- Add a Patient
- Add an appointment
- View all patient details
- View all doctor details
- View all appointment details
-  Delete data

# Patient Module:
- Sign in to system
- Add an appointment
- View appointments 3)Doctor Module:
- Sign in to system
- View patients
- View appointments

# Specifications
1. We have used different libraries for various purposes.
2. Bool datatype has been used to keep a check on the conditions on various
points.
3. We have used global variables that are common in different classes and
functions, for ease of accessing and using.
4. Classes have been used for each members with different member
functions for functionality. Concepts of inheritance have been
demonstrated in the project.
5. File handling is done to manage and store all data records.
6. For choice choosing interface, if-else statements and switch statements
have been used.
7. Goto statement has been used to go back to homepage purpose.
